This is a site made as a school project where you can vote for and see results of all Norwegian political parties.

I have included a preview of how the site looks, but if you want all functionality, you have to follow these steps:
  1. Download files
  2. Extract zip file
  3. Download Visual studio if not already installed.
  4. inside the extracted folder, go to voting-site-master and open valgside.sln with visual stuio.
  5. Once fully loaded, open the solution explorer on the top right of the program and right click on the second highest tab called valgside.
  6. Here you need to click manage nuget packages and go to updates where you update all (just in case).
  7. Once updated, double click / open Default.aspx back in the solution explorer.
  8. Once opened, click the arrow + IIS Express button on the top of the program and enjoy the site.

  * To vote, you need to add a norwegian identification number and choose a city in Norway that you live in.
    Then click on a party, where you can click again to send in the vote.

  * If you click "Flere partier" you will get more of a choice and if you click "Resultater" in the top left you get the results of all votes in the database.

  * The website is connected to my old shcools database, so please no hack.
